# Haku-File-Renamer

Haku-File-Renamer is a simple script I wrote in order to automatically rename all .epub files in all subfolders from HakuNeko's download folder.

Why was it done? Because chapter names were not being properly sorted as they did not include zeroes. 
This means that chapters 11, 12, ... 19 were listed before chapter 2 (and so on).

This script renames files following the pattern "folder name_0000.epub".
You may tweak it to cover .pdf / .cbz or whatever extension you are using.
